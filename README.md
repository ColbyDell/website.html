    <h1>My background with Coding</h1>
    <p>I first started hearing about coding from my father. He has always been in the technology buisness, but he first starting with coding for fun. He wanted me to understand how it works at about the age of eight or nine. I revisted coding within the past year, and that's why I took my Computer Sciences class. I was so interested to learn about how cumuters run the way they do. 
    <h1>The Past of Coding</h1>
    <p> Coding originally started with dials and switches for computing major amounts of math.
